Description: The purpose of this package is to tests whether a given 
             moment of the distribution of a given sample is finite or not. For 
             heavy-tailed distributions with tail exponent b, only moments of 
             order smaller than b are finite. Tail exponent and heavy-
             tailedness are notoriously difficult to ascertain. But the 
             finiteness of moments (including fractional moments) can be tested 
             directly. This package does that following the test suggested by 
             Trapani (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.08.006>.
